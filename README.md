# MersenneTwisterApplication
This project is to test the &lt;random> header. And to take my fist steps with the unit testing features of visual studio 15. 

The first upload into GIT is the compiler generated project.
After one night of blood & sweat & tears:
- The code can be run from the unit test and the console app. not 100% sure the construction is correct. but this setup allows for easy debugging in console and unit test. Debugging a static library was not workable. drawback is that the files to test need to be pulled into the unit test project.
- The single dice throw works. But everything about it can be improved. 
- millions and millions of random numbers to generate. (done 8/19. Well one million generated in the unit test.

Todo:
- millions and millions of random numbers to generate. (in paralel, it is 2015, not 1995...)
- fancy user interface to show it all off.
